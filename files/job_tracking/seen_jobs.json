    "description": "I am seeking a developer or automation specialist to build a system that:\n\n1. Parses incoming property leads (via email and/or SMS) to extract relevant\ninformation (address, price, units, etc.).\n\n2. Queries RentCast (or a similar rent estimate service) to gather rental\ndata (current rent, rent comps, etc.).\n\n3. Populates a Google Sheet with key data (address, rent estimate, cash-on-\ncash return, etc.).\n\n4. Handles special logic for multi-unit properties (7+ units) to store or\ntransform data differently.\n\n5. Keeps daily API costs to under $0.50/day.\n\n\n---\n\n2. Project Goals\n\n\n\nAutomation: Eliminate manual copy-pasting of property addresses, rent\nestimates, and ROI calculations.\n\nAccuracy: Ensure data extracted and rent estimates are consistently accurate.\n\nScalability & Cost Control: Handle a growing number of leads while staying\nwithin a $0.50/day API budget.\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. Scope and Requirements\n\n\n\n3.1. Data Capture & Parsing\n\n1. Sources: The system should capture data from:\n\nEmail: Some leads arrive via email (with property details or direct links to\nlistings).\n\nText Messages (SMS): Some leads arrive via text, which may be forwarded\nthrough services like Twilio or Zapier.\n\n\n\n2. Parsing Fields:\n\nAddress (required for RentCast lookup)\n\nProperty Purchase Price (if available)\n\nNumber of Units (important for 7+ unit logic)\n\nAny additional fields that might be relevant (e.g., link to the listing,\nagent\u2019s contact info, etc.).\n\n\n\n3. Preferred Tools (flexible):\n\nZapier, Make (Integromat), or a custom solution in Python/Node.js/Google Apps\nScript.\n\nMust ensure reliability and easy maintainability.\n\n\n\n\n3.2. RentCast Integration\n\n1. Retrieve Rent Estimates:\n\nUse RentCast\u2019s API (or equivalent) to get current rent, high/low estimates, or\naverage rents for the ZIP code.\n\nIf the property listing already contains the current rent, incorporate that\ninto the data.\n\n\n\n2. API Cost Constraints:\n\nThe system should not exceed $0.50/day in API usage.\n\nMinimize duplicates: Only call RentCast once per unique address.\n\nPotentially batch calls or check for repeated addresses.\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Google Sheets Integration\n\n1. Data Columns in Google Sheets should include (but aren\u2019t limited to):\n\nTimestamp (date the lead was processed)\n\nAddress\n\nPurchase Price\n\nNumber of Units\n\nMonthly Rent Estimate\n\nOther rent comps or relevant data from RentCast\n\nCash-on-Cash Return (see next section)\n\nNotes or Status field for manual follow-up.\n\n\n\n2. Handling 7+ Units:\n\nIf Units less than 7, either:\n\nInsert data into a separate tab (e.g., \u201c7+ Units\u201d tab), or\n\nEncode or summarize the data differently (e.g., partial data, redacted\nfinancials).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4. Cash-on-Cash Return Calculation\n\n1. Inputs:\n\nPurchase Price (from the lead or manually estimated)\n\nRent (from the listing and/or RentCast estimates)\n\nDown Payment (might be a standard % or a column in the sheet)\n\nExpenses (option to assume a percentage or a fixed amount)\n\nMortgage Payment (if financed; can be estimated or left as a variable input)\n\n\n\n2. Formula:\n\nAnnual Net Cash Flow = (Monthly Rent \u2013 Monthly Expenses \u2013 Mortgage) \u00d7 12\n\nTotal Cash Invested = Down Payment + Closing Costs (if applicable)\n\nCash-on-Cash Return % = (Annual Net Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) \u00d7 100\n\n\n\n3. Implementation:\n\nCan be calculated within Google Sheets (preferred for easier tweaking of\nassumptions).\n\nAlternatively, can be calculated in the automation script.\n\n\n\n\n3.5. Error Handling & Edge Cases\n\n1. Duplicate Addresses: If the same property address is sent multiple times,\nensure we do not duplicate RentCast calls unnecessarily.\n\n\n2. Missing Data: Some leads may be missing purchase price or unit count. The\nsystem should log them but still attempt to fill whatever data is available.\n\n\n3. Notification/Logging: If a lead is processed successfully, optionally send\na notification (email or Slack) if it meets a certain ROI threshold\n(optional).\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Technical Details & Constraints\n\n\n5. Platform/Hosting:\n\nIf using a no-code tool (Zapier, Make), you must specify the steps needed.\n\nIf using a custom script (e.g., Google Apps Script or a serverless function),\nit must be well-documented for future maintenance.\n\n\n\n6. User Authentication:\n\nSecurely handle the RentCast API key (do not store in plain text in public\ncode repositories).\n\n\n\n7. Daily API Budget:\n\nProvide a method to track the number of calls to ensure we stay under\n$0.50/day.\n\nImplement caching or a check on previously-seen addresses.\n\n\n\n8. Google Sheet Setup:\n\nMust be able to handle 100+ properties without performance issues.\n\nMust accommodate dynamic columns for additional data or notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. Deliverables\n\n\n6. Fully Functional Automated Workflow\n\nDemonstrates end-to-end process: from an example email/SMS to data populating\nin Google Sheets with rent estimates and calculations.\n\n\n\n7. Configuration & Setup Guide\n\nInstructions on how to set up or modify the API keys (RentCast, Twilio, etc.).\n\nInstructions on how to edit the Google Sheet formulas or columns.\n\n\n\n8. Source Code/Access\n\nIf code-based: Provide the script files or links to GitHub.\n\nIf no-code: Provide screenshots or instructions for the Zapier/Make workflows.\n\n\n\n9. Testing & Validation\n\nAt least one test property address to confirm the system retrieves rent data,\ncalculates ROI, and handles the 7+ unit logic.\n\n\n\n10. Documentation\n\nA short write-up on how to maintain and troubleshoot the system in case of\nerrors (e.g., API downtime, changes in email format).\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n6. Timeline\n\n\n\nProposal Submission: Immediately upon job posting.\n\nProject Start: Within 1 week of awarding the job.\n\nMVP Completion: 1\u20132 weeks after project start (basic address parsing + rent\ndata retrieval + sheet entry).\n\nFinal Delivery: 2\u20133 weeks after project start (include the ROI calculations,\n7+ unit handling, thorough testing).\n\n\n\n---\n\n7. Budget\n\n\n\nOpen to proposals, with an emphasis on:\n\nMinimizing monthly costs (aiming for $15/month total, including the RentCast\nusage).\n\nEnsuring reliability of the automation.\n\n\n\n---\n\n8. Selection Criteria\n\n\n9. Relevant Experience: Experience with property analysis, automating\nemail/SMS parsing, Google Sheets, or Zapier/Make.\n\n\n10. Portfolio/References: Previous work or references for similar automation\ntasks.\n\n\n11. Solution Approach: Clear plan to keep API calls under $0.50/day, handle\nduplicates, and maintain data integrity.\n\n\n12. Communication & Documentation: Ability to provide clear instructions and\nmaintenance guidance.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n9. How to Apply / Next Steps\n\n\n\nSubmit a brief proposal explaining:\n\n1. Your approach (Zapier? Custom script?)\n\n\n2. High-level architecture you envision\n\n\n3. Estimated timeline and cost\n\n\n\nProvide examples or links to similar projects you\u2019ve completed.\nInclude the word \u201cPropertyROI\u201d in your response to confirm you\u2019ve read the\ndetails.\n\n\n---\n\nAlso want realtor interface to see scenarios and enter repairs or answer\nmissing quality questions about property\n\nBonus $15 if can like with offermarket us for rates\n\nAI generated",

    "description": "A previous developer helped me build an AI voice agent in VAPI and n8n.  \n  \nThe agent currently takes inbound calls like a receptionist. The agent responds to callers giving business information, pricing and FAQs. It also sets appointments by looking at a calendar (already setup) and suggests available times.  \n  \nCurrent tech stack  \nGCP - google calendar  \nN8n - workflows  \nVAPI - voice AI  \nOpenAI - chat summarisation  \nTwilio - phone number  \n  \nWe are stuck on a Stripe implementation where the agent sends a payment link (eg via email or SMS) to the caller to make a payment to confirm the appointment. Need support specifically in completing this part of the flow.  \n  \nSo the flow should be  \n1. Caller rings number  \n2.  AI agent answers and provides business information, and offers to  set up an appointment   \n3. Callers asks availability on certain days  \n4. agent checks calendar and confirms or proposes alternative times  \n5. Caller agree on time, agent books the appointment and sends calendar\ninvite and confirms booking over phone, then politely ends call.  \n  \n  \nAdditional step to be added  \n- before step 5 above, Agent asks caller for email address to send a payment\nlink (stripe)  \n- after caller completes payment - agent checks for payment confirmation. If\nconfirmed, agent tells caller that the payment is successful and then we move\nto step 5 above.  \n- If payment unsuccessful, it tells caller that it was unsuccessful and asks\nto try again. If still unsuccessful, it tells caller that the appointment is\nnot confirmed and that we will pass on to someone who will call back to take\npayment over the phone.  \n  \nThis should be a quick integration as it is testing the flow and stripe\nintegration. We have done most of the work and requires an experienced AI\nagent to complete.  \n  \nThis must be completed by Friday this week.",

    "description": "We are looking to build an AI-powered classroom website for teachers, very similar in functionality to Google Classroom except this will include AI chat tasks that are graded.  \n  \nThe website will allow teachers to create and manage multiple classrooms for different subjects. In each classroom, the teacher can upload educational content in the form of PDF files to serve as modules. Students can access and complete tasks.  \n  \nFeatures:  \n  \n    Teachers can create modules and upload PDF files with relevant content.  \n    Teachers can set instructions for the AI bot (e.g., \"10 questions a day on addition\").  \n    Students log into their profiles daily, select the module, and interact with the AI chatbot.  \n    The AI bot will present 10 questions, and when the student answers correctly, it will proceed to the next question. If the student answers incorrectly, the bot will explain the mistake and allow the student to ask questions before moving forward.  \n    At the end of the 10 questions, the AI bot records the student\u2019s score, which is saved in a gradebook similar to Google Classroom.  \n    The platform tracks the student\u2019s overall progress and grades across multiple modules (e.g., Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division for math).  \n  \nTeacher\u2019s Dashboard:  \n  \n    Teachers can monitor student progress, view grades, and track the completion of modules.  \n    Teachers can create different classrooms for various subjects and upload multiple modules for each.  \n  \nAdditional Requirement: The website should be designed with future mobile app\nintegration in mind. We plan to transition the platform into a mobile app\n(iOS) via the App Store at a later point, allowing students to easily access\nand complete their modules on their phones. Please design the site with this\nscalability in mind.  \n  \nRequirements:  \n  \n    Experience in building interactive web platforms with AI integration.  \n    Familiarity with building gradebook systems and dashboards for educators.  \n    Experience with chatbot development and AI-powered learning tools.  \n    WordPress is the preferred platform for this project. We are looking for a developer who is experienced with WordPress and its plugins. Please include suggestions for any plugins you would consider using to build the site.  \n  \nTo Be Considered: If you are interested in this project, please submit a proof\nof concept. This could include any past AI-integrated projects (student,\nteacher, or user group projects, etc.) and a clear plan for how you would\nexecute this project. Please include details on the plugins you would use, how\nyou would integrate the AI functionality, and any tools or technologies you\nwould recommend for this build.",

    "description": "We\u2019re building an AI-powered SaaS platform aimed at revolutionizing healthcare communication. Our goal is to create a real-time speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and live language translation system tailored specifically for medical environments. This system must be able to handle multiple languages, be extremely accurate in its translations, and operate seamlessly in real-time, ensuring it can be used in high-stress situations without errors. One of our key challenges is ensuring voice differentiation based on context \u2014 for instance, the system should automatically detect whether it's a male or female speaker and adjust the voice accordingly. We also need the platform to provide natural-sounding speech outputs, so the voice feels human and approachable, particularly in high-stress healthcare settings where patient comfort and trust are critical. We\u2019re also very focused on making sure the system\u2019s output is clear and easy to understand in emergency scenarios. The system must adhere to the strictest privacy standards and comply with GDPR regulations, as we will be handling sensitive patient data. We need someone with experience in building secure, scalable platforms with a deep understanding of AI, natural language processing, and large language models like GPT, as well as real-time data processing. Ideally, you\u2019ll also have experience integrating APIs, working with cloud services, and ensuring smooth interactions between text, voice, and various languages in real-time. You should be comfortable working with both frontend and backend technologies, have a strong grasp of SaaS development, and be capable of collaborating with a team to deliver timely, high-quality work. We value innovation and are looking for a partner who\u2019s excited about the opportunity to push boundaries in healthcare technology. We also need someone who understands the importance of accuracy, reliability, and empathy when it comes to medical communication, as this could significantly impact the quality of care that the patients receive. This is a chance to join a project with a huge potential for positive impact on millions of people around the world. If you\u2019re passionate about AI, healthcare, and solving real-world problems, we\u2019d love to have you on board. Let\u2019s work together to build something that can truly make a difference in the lives of patients and healthcare professionals everywhere. Thank you.",

Here's a list of approved sources to pull articles from:  <https://sparktoro.com/blog/> <https://detailed.com/latest/> <https://zyppy.com/seo/> <https://www.growth-memo.com/archive> <https://ipullrank.com/blog> <https://www.semrush.com/blog/> <https://ahrefs.com/blog/> <https://searchengineland.com/library/seo> <https://www.seroundtable.com/category/google> <https://www.searchenginejournal.com/category/seo/> <https://brodieclark.com/notes/>    Step 2 - Write a 1 paragraph summary with 2-4 sentences for each for each article.    Step 3 - Write 3-5 bullet points detailing the key takeaways from each article, and why an eCommerce store owner should care.    Step 4 - Write a unique \"SEO Tip of the Month\" to feature at the beginning of the newsletter that is helpful and actionable.    Step 5 - Publish to Wordpress    ### Expectations ###    I'm hoping to automate as much or all of this process as possible, while generating outputs that are very close to the previous newsletter examples:  - <https://www.180marketing.com/this-month-in-ecommerce-seo-may-2024/>  - <https://www.180marketing.com/this-month-in-ecommerce-seo-june-2024/>  - <https://www.180marketing.com/this-month-in-ecommerce-seo-july-2024/>    I will be testing the automation for December 2024 to assess the quality of the newsletter. There's a few things I will be looking for.  1. How appealing are the selected articles for an eCommerce store owner?  2. How well written are the article summaries?  3. How insightful are the article takeaways?  4. Does the style and tone match the newsletter examples provided?",

We built an AI to help them answer these questions, and they want to direct those people to their AI. This project would be an ongoing project, a few hours per day, answering people's questions and linking them to the AI for more info. An example might be: Steve asks: \"what's the best workout for getting bigger biceps?\" You might say something like: Hey Steve! \ud83d\udcaa Thanks for reaching out about building bigger biceps. I've done some posts about that, but it really depends on your specific situation - things like your current routine, recovery capacity, and nutrition all play a huge role in muscle growth. The context makes a big difference. That's why instead of generic tips, I've created something really cool that I think you'll love - an AI version of myself that's available 24/7, with all my knowledge and experience baked into it, and it comes with some game-changing features: - It can measure your body fat % and track muscle gains using just your phone camera - Creates personalized nutrition plans specifically for muscle growth - Designs custom workouts based on your equipment and schedule and a ton more.. we kinda went crazy with it haha Here's the link: [AI LINK] Start with a body scan and let AI me design your perfect bicep-building plan. The tracking features will help you see exactly what's working! Let me know how you like it! Tag me in any progress updates \ud83d\udd25",

    "description": "In September, we developed an AI chatbot using the standard RAG (Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation) LangChain framework combined with Azure API to chat with\nPDFs. Specifically, we leveraged Azure Form Recognizer to remove headers,\nfooters, and specific parts of PDFs, enhancing the context of ingested data\ninto the vector database. Additionally, we used the OpenAI Vision model to\ndescribe images within PDFs and store these descriptions in the vector\ndatabase.  \n  \nProblem:  \nSince September, updates to dependencies have caused the code to stop working\nas expected. The system now fails to capture and describe images using the\nOpenAI Vision model during ingestion.  \n  \nAfter investigating, I found that OpenAI has changed the name of the Vision\nmodel and some functions within the LangChain framework, requiring updates. I\ndecided to update all dependencies, but this introduced additional issues with\nAzure. Azure has undergone significant changes, replacing Form Recognizer with\nAzure AI Document Intelligence, further complicating the update process.  \n  \nI am looking for someone to help restore the functionalities of my chatbot,\nensuring all dependencies are updated and the bot works as intended.  \n  \nFuture Scope:  \nAs a follow-up task, there may be an opportunity to migrate from the classical\nRAG framework to the GraphRAG framework, which is a cutting-edge and trending\napproach.",

I know that folks all over the web are charging thousands to build and\nthen $1000 per month or more to maintain chatbots for people, but \"the cat is\nout of the bag\" for me. I know most developers are using a platform like\nVoiceFlow and really overcharging customers.  I'll get a VoiceFlow account and\nhave you build it out, test it, etc., and I will pay you for your knowledge\nand work.  Are you cool with that?  \n  \nIf you know what you are doing and have very good English, I'd like to work\nwith you on this.  \n  \nThanks!",

    "description": "So this project is already built but there are issues with the AI agent that\u2019s generating the tweets now. So I mainly need someone that can fix this.  \nCheck out this loom to understand the issue: <https://www.loom.com/share/0997a20cb41c4d438ff8b9e372879abb>  \nIn simple terms, we need to make the tweet generation feature perfect.  \n  \nSo this is the current flow of the app:  \n\\- using apify to scrape tweets from a persons profile on X  \n\\- using the scraped tweets to GPT-4o to understand the tweeting behaviours and style and generate tweets  \n  \n(But this is not giving good enough outputs)  \nSo we need to either do SFT (supervised fine tuning) to a model. Or any other approach that you think might work. We could also build some type of RAG architecture to make this better. Open to ideas.  \n  \nAt the end of the day, the product needs to replicate the tweeting style of a person. So let\u2019s say they don\u2019t use capital letters, our agent shouldn\u2019t use it. If they don\u2019t use hashtags, our agent don\u2019t use it. If they don\u2019t use emojis, our agent shouldn\u2019t use that either. But let\u2019s say they use slangs and gen z terminology, then our agent shouldn\u2019t pick up that pattern and use that. Let\u2019s say the user says some bad words frequently, the agent should also use that.  \n  \nBasically it needs to feel like that real person is tweeting, whatever it takes to get there.  \n  \nAI generated responses will automatically be declined.

    "description": "Project Title: Developing Intelligent Chinese Knowledge Base System--Document Database and Natural Language Query Implementation  \nProject Overview: We are building an intelligent Chinese knowledge base, which aims to help students and teachers better learn and teach Chinese through efficient data collation and classification, semantic search and auxiliary learning functions. Now we need to find experienced developers or teams to help implement the following two core technology modules:  \n1.Document database: Transform existing Chinese materials (texts, exercises, study guides, lesson plans, etc.) into a structured database, including semantic embedding generation and association annotation.  \n2.Natural language query to SQL: Develop a system that can automatically convert users' natural language questions into SQL query statements, retrieve relevant information from the database and generate intelligent answers.  \nDetailed requirements:  \n1. Database of documents  \n\uf0b7Data collation and classification:  \noDesign and create the corresponding database table structure according to the classification criteria provided, including but not limited to:  \n\uf0a7Text table: stores the content of the text and its unique identifier.  \n\uf0a7Resource table: stores after-class exercises, study guides, lesson plans, etc.  \n\uf0a7Association table: stores the association information between texts and resources (such as association type: strong/weak).  \n\uf0b7Database design:  \noExample table structure:  \n\uf0a7Text table: ID Text title Text content embedding vector  \n\uf0a7Resource table: ID type (exercises/guidelines/lesson plans) content embedding vector  \n\uf0a7Association table: Text ID Resource ID Association type (strong/weak)  \n\uf0b7Semantic embedding generation:  \noUse advanced embedding models (such as BERT, GPT, etc.) to generate vector representations of texts and related resources, and store them in databases for support vector retrieval (such as Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.).  \n\uf0b7Relationship annotation:  \noBased on the annotation of teachers or language experts, an accurate mapping relationship between the text and its related resources is established to ensure the relevance and accuracy of the retrieval results.  \n2. Convert natural language query to SQL  \n\uf0b7Semantic search flow:  \noAfter the user enters keywords or questions, the system needs to be able to understand the user's intention, automatically generate corresponding SQL query statements, and retrieve matching texts and related resources from the database.  \noThe returned results need to be sorted according to the degree of relevance, and related resources, such as exercises, study guides, lesson plans, etc., are automatically supplemented.  \n\uf0b7Example functionality:  \noUser search: \"Contents of an article and related exercises\"  \n\uf0a7Returns:  \n\uf0a7Contents: The full content of this article.  \n\uf0a7Exercises: After-class exercises corresponding to this article.  \n\uf0a7Guidelines: Learning suggestions for this article.  \n\uf0a7Lesson plan: Teacher's explanation ideas.  \n\uf0b7External data integration:  \noWhen the data in the database is insufficient to answer the user's question, the system should be able to obtain relevant content through external search or API, and combine it with the existing database content to generate a complete answer.  \nAdditional requirements:  \n3. Assisted learning function (optional module)  \n\uf0b7Knowledge points are explained step by step:  \noUse models such as GPT to generate easy-to-understand step-by-step explanations of complex Chinese knowledge points.  \n\uf0b7Supplementary content generation:  \noAutomatically generate illustrations, example sentences, and small tests to help students consolidate their knowledge.  \n\uf0b7Context-related display:  \noAfter students enter knowledge points, they will display relevant extended content and background knowledge to provide comprehensive learning resources.  \nSkill Requirements:  \n\uf0b7Database design and management:  \noFamiliarity with relational databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL) or non-relational databases (e.g. MongoDB).  \noExperience uses vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for semantic embedding storage and retrieval.  \n\uf0b7Natural language processing (NLP):  \noFamiliar with using NLP models (such as BERT, GPT) for text embedding and semantic understanding.  \noProject experience converting natural language to SQL queries.  \n\uf0b7Programming languages and frameworks:  \noProficient in Python or other programming languages suitable for NLP and database operations.  \noFamiliarity with using relevant NLP libraries (e.g. spaCy, Transformers) and database interfaces.  \n\uf0b7API development and integration:  \noBe able to develop RESTful API to realize data interaction between front and back ends.  \noExperience integrating 3rd party APIs, particularly in data acquisition and processing.  \n\uf0b7Project Management and Collaboration:  \noGood communication skills, able to understand project requirements and complete tasks efficiently.  \noExperience with version control tools such as Git.  \nProject Delivery:  \n\uf0b7Stage 1: Complete the database design and construction, import the initial data, generate and store semantic embedding.  \n\uf0b7Stage 2: Develop natural language query to SQL module to realize basic query functions.  \n\uf0b7Stage 3: Optimize the retrieval and answer generation logic to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the answers.  \n\uf0b7Stage 4 (optional): Integrate assisted learning functions to improve user experience.  \nProject budget: Please make a reasonable quotation according to your experience and project needs.  \nProject duration: It is hoped that the entire project will be completed within [specific time frame, such as 3 months], which can be negotiated according to the development progress.  \nHow to apply: Please provide the following information so that we can better understand your abilities and experience:  \n1.Relevant project experience and case sharing.  \n2.A brief description of the technical proposal, explaining how you will implement the above requirements.  \n3.Project quotation and estimated completion time.  \n4.Other information that you feel will be helpful in the application.  \nLooking forward to cooperating with you to build an efficient and practical intelligent Chinese knowledge base system!",

    "description": "I am an insurance expert, and part of my role involves reviewing and correcting reports written by experts in training. These reports are often sent to me via Microsoft Teams or Outlook, and I am looking to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence.  \n  \nThe goal of this project is to develop a solution that can analyze Word and PDF documents, detect inconsistencies or missing information, and either annotate the document directly or provide a detailed summary of corrections. The solution must also integrate with Microsoft tools (Teams and Outlook) to streamline communication and feedback.  \n  \nIn my work, I rely on a set of conventions and rules specific to the insurance industry. These include guidelines tied to specific damage thresholds, which dictate the coverage and management of claims. I will provide these conventions and participate in the AI training process to ensure the system delivers accurate and contextually relevant feedback. I trust the developer to propose the most effective way to implement this training.  \n  \nWhat I Need the Solution to Do:  \n  \nDocument Analysis and Annotation:  \nIdentify missing details, errors, or inconsistencies in Word and PDF documents.  \nAnnotate directly in the document or create a structured summary of required corrections.  \nExample: Highlight a missing detail in the section \u201cCauses and Circumstances\u201d and suggest adding specifics about the origin of damages.  \nFeedback Generation:  \n  \nSummarize missing or incorrect elements in a clear, actionable format.  \nProvide page-by-page or line-by-line feedback when applicable.  \n  \nMicrosoft Integration:  \nSeamlessly connect with Microsoft Outlook and Teams to retrieve emails and documents.  \nAutomate responses to team members with annotated reports or summarized feedback.  \nAI Training on Insurance Conventions:  \n  \nIntegrate insurance-specific conventions and rules that dictate claim coverage based on damage thresholds.  \nAdapt the AI to provide recommendations that align with these conventions.  \n  \nDeliverables:  \nAn AI-powered tool capable of:  \nReading and analyzing Word and PDF documents.  \nAnnotating documents or generating a detailed summary of corrections.  \nIntegration with Microsoft Outlook and Teams for efficient communication and document sharing.",

Research tool  \n  \nThe goal is to fetch data from Google reviews, Google, News websites, social media channels, blogs, market reports, company registers, podcasts, webinars, databases, pictures, videos and other relevant channels  \n  \nInput scope: It should give results from people and companies..So if my client as a CEO wants to find data from some of their clients (company and contact person) so that they can provide a more personal service then it should be able to provide insights for both situations (company and individual)  \n  \nOutput scope: text, pictures, videos, charts, tables...  \n  \nI dont have any APIs in mind - if you can suggest that would be great  \n  \nI dont have a specific tech in mind either - you can suggest based on best practices  \n  \nUse cases  \n  \n1. CEO can research competition and compare their own business vs competitive advantage insights, having a better understanding of the global market trends and using that information to create interesting content (the software should suggest this as well)  \n2. Social media managers - are spending a lot of time on research about their clients. So same idea as above  \n3. Sales - Same as above  \n4. Better understanding of competitive advantages, news and market compared to the users company so that they can create more impactful content  \n  \n2. Phone interview tool  \n  \nI'm a headhunter so my goal is to help with my own work and I would need an autonomous AI agent to handle tasks like  \n  \n- when an application arrives the AI assistant sends them an email suggesting a phone call  \n- the assistant would handle the phone call based to questions I want to know and maybe some additional questions from the applicant's CV (if possible)  \n- if the AI agent could also learn to ask questions during the phone conversation that would be great  \n- then I would get the insights of that first phone call in text format so that I can determine if I should schedule a next interview myself  \n- in a best case scenario the assistant would send the applicant this one particular personality analysis test to be filled out. AND AFTER THIS the assistant would analyse that result, analyze the CV - AND THEN create additional questions (on top of fixed ones) for the first phase of the interview process - a phone interview  \n  \nSo kind of like this  \n  \n1. step candidate send an application  \n2. AI agent responds, thanks for your application, before the first interview here is a personality analysis I would like you to do  \n3. Phone interview: after the candidate has done the analysis, AI agent analyses that and CV before making the call  \n4. Insights: text analysis for me about the interview and personality fit and would this person be a fit / to continue the process  \n  \nDo these instructions make sense? Need more info?  \nWould like to know about your AI projects and considering your workload, when would you be able get this done?",

    "description": "We are seeking an experienced developer (or team) to build a scalable web crawler that will continuously gather content (text, images, and video) from a list of local news websites. Our goal is to ingest this data into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) marketplace. The solution must be built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and store data in Amazon S3, with a focus on reliability, performance, and adaptability.  \n  \nSCOPE OF WORK  \n1. Input Source (CSV of Websites)  \n-We will provide a CSV file containing the domain names or specific URLs of local news websites.  \n-The crawler must be capable of dynamically reading this list and adding/removing URLs from the crawl schedule.  \n  \n2. Crawling & Parsing  \n-Text: Extract body text, headlines, author names, publication dates, etc.  \n-Images: Gather image URLs or directly download and store them.  \n-Videos: Identify and capture embedded video links or associated metadata (e.g., YouTube or local video players)  \n-Must be able to handle basic JavaScript-rendered pages (if applicable) using headless browsing tools (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright).  \n  \n3. Data Storage  \n-All crawled assets (text, images, video references) must be saved to Amazon S3.  \n-A clear and consistent folder structure is required (e.g., s3://bucket-name/site-name/YYYY-MM-DD/...).  \n-Metadata (e.g., title, author, timestamp, tags/categories) should be stored in a structured format (JSON, CSV, or database if applicable).  \n  \n4. Recrawl and Scheduling  \n-The crawler must run hourly by default, but this interval should be configurable (could be daily, weekly, or custom).  \n-Concurrency & rate-limiting to avoid overwhelming small news sites (e.g., back-off strategies, max requests per second, etc.).  \n  \n5. Real-time Pipeline & Notifications  \n-The system should integrate seamlessly with our RAG marketplace ingestion pipeline.  \n-An optional webhook or API trigger can be included to notify us as soon as new/updated content is available.  \n  \n6. Monitoring & Error Handling  \n-Implement robust logging (Stackdriver / Cloud Logging) and monitoring (Cloud Monitoring) for crawl statistics and errors.  \n-Alerting system for any major failures or repeated timeouts.  \n-Retry and exponential back-off on transient network errors or site outages.  \n  \n7. Scalability & Resilience  \n-The crawler should be able to scale horizontally (e.g., GCP Compute Engine instances, Kubernetes, or Cloud Run).  \n-Ensure fault tolerance to handle unexpected crashes, with automatic restart or job re-distribution.  \n  \n8. Security & Compliance  \n-Respect robots.txt directives or site-specific terms of service (where appropriate/required).  \n-Use secure secret management (e.g., GCP Secret Manager) for any credentials.  \n-Adhere to HTTPS/SSL best practices and handle secure connections to websites.  \n  \n9. Documentation & Deliverables  \n-Solution design document detailing architecture, technology stack, and data flow.  \n-Deployment guide with step-by-step instructions (including environment setup, scaling, and how to add/remove sites).  \n-Clear instructions on how to extend or modify the system to accommodate new data sources or advanced features (e.g., NLP or content tagging).  \n  \nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS  \n1. Language & Frameworks  \n-Preferred: Python (Scrapy, Requests, Puppeteer via Pyppeteer/Playwright) or Node.js (Playwright, Puppeteer).  \n-Must have familiarity with GCP services (e.g., GCE, GKE, Cloud Run, Pub/Sub).  \n  \n2. Infrastructure  \n-Deployed on Google Cloud Platform with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).  \n-Storage in Amazon S3 (via direct API or through bridging solutions if needed).  \n-Must integrate with GCP logging and monitoring tools.  \n  \n3. Version Control & Testing  \n-All code should be stored in a Git repository.  \n-Include unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests for crawler functionality.  \n-Peer reviews or documented code review process is a plus.  \n  \n4. Optional / Nice-to-Have  \n-Admin UI to manage sites and crawl schedules.  \n-Automated summarization or entity extraction (NLP) for better indexing.  \n-Proxy management to handle any IP blocking or geofencing issues.  \n-Change detection (delta updates) to store only diffs if content is unchanged.  \n  \nQUALIFICATIONS  \n-Proven experience building web crawlers or large-scale scraping systems in production environments.  \n-Solid knowledge of both GCP and AWS ecosystems  \n-Familiarity with headless browsers (Puppeteer, Playwright) and rate-limiting best practices.  \n-Strong understanding of HTML parsing, JSON/XML feeds, and advanced scraping strategies.  \n-Ability to document code and processes thoroughly, including how-to guides and architectural decisions.  \n-Excellent communication skills and willingness to provide regular progress updates.  \n  \nWHAT WE PROVIDE  \n-A CSV with a preliminary list of local news websites.  \n-Credentials/permissions for GCP and AWS (S3) as required.  \n-Access to our existing RAG marketplace pipeline documentation, to ensure compatibility.  \n-Clear acceptance criteria and success metrics (e.g., # of pages crawled, error rates, refresh intervals).  \n  \nDELIVERABLES AND TIMELINE  \n1. Phase 1  \n-Architectural design and deployment outline.  \n-Basic crawler prototype running on GCP and storing to S3.  \n  \n2. Phase 2:  \n-Full-scale crawler with dynamic scheduling, error handling, and logging.  \n-Preliminary documentation and basic test coverage.  \n  \n3. Phase 3  \n-Optimization for concurrency, performance tuning, and final documentation hand-off.  \n-Optional extras (admin UI, NLP enhancements) based on discussion.  \n  \nWe expect the project to start immediately and aim for a 2-4 week initial\nbuild timeframe, with possible ongoing maintenance or enhancements afterward.  \n  \nHOW TO APPLY  \nPlease respond with:  \n1. A brief portfolio or description of relevant crawler/scaling projects\nyou\u2019ve worked on.  \n2. An outline of your proposed architecture, technology stack, and approach.  \n3. Your estimated timeline and budget range for the described scope.  \n4. Any questions or clarifications you might need from us.  \n  \nWe look forward to collaborating with a talented developer who can bring this\nproject to life and ensure a robust, real-time content ingestion pipeline for\nour RAG marketplace. If this sounds like a match for your skill set, we\u2019d love\nto hear from you!",

We\u2019ve already completed on the core authentication and basic functionality (Next.js + Supabase), payments workflows, so you won\u2019t be starting from scratch.  Now I need a Full-Stack Engineer to take the project further by implementing advanced features and ensuring a robust, scalable architecture.  Responsibilities  \\- Feature Development: Build out scheduling functionality (multi-location support, staff calendars, waiting lists, etc.).  \\- Integration & Customisation: Connect third-party services (e.g., calendar tools, gateways) and eventually enhance with AI or advanced analytics if you have that experience.  \\- Performance & Security: Ensure the platform runs efficiently and securely, implementing best practices for data handling, role-based access, and compliance.  \\- Scalability & Maintainability: Propose and implement improvements to the existing code for better performance and future extensibility.  \\- Collaboration & Documentation: Work with me to refine requirements, and document your processes, decisions, and code so future development is seamless.  Requirements  \\- Proficient with Next.js & Supabase: You can quickly understand our existing codebase, which includes authentication and some foundational endpoints.  \\- Full-Stack Experience: Solid background in front-end (React/Next.js) and back-end (Node/SQL/ORMs).  \\- API Integrations: Familiar with integrating external APIs, especially for calendars and payments (Stripe or similar).  \\- Git & CI/CD: Comfortable with version control and setting up or maintaining continuous integration/deployment pipelines.  Communication & Documentation: Able to work in a remote collaboration environment, provide clear updates, and write thorough documentation.  \\- AI/ML Knowledge: Any experience with AI-driven analytics or chatbot integrations is a bonus.  \\- UI/UX Skills: If you can also refine the user interface or collaborate on design improvements, that\u2019s a plus.  Plus-to-Have  \\- DevOps Expertise: Experience with infrastructure-as-code, containerization, or advanced CI/CD setups.  Why This Project? Foundation in Place: An existing Next.js + Supabase codebase is ready, so you\u2019re not starting from scratch. You can jump in and make an impact right away.  Engagement Details  Scope: Initially focused on building core features, refining the codebase, and integrating critical services. Potential to expand into new features if it\u2019s a good fit.  Next Steps:  \\- Share examples of your previous Next.js or Supabase projects , AI based projects, or any scheduling/booking-focused apps you\u2019ve worked on.  \\- Provide a brief overview of how you\u2019d approach this engagement and any best practices you\u2019d recommend.",

The finder returns a variety of ideas influenced by these inputs.  \n  \nCustomers create wish/ideas lists for the children\u2019s birthdays, which in turn power reminder emails with gift ideas  \n  \nBy leveraging AI, we aim to provide a seamless and personal gift finding experience, collecting and utilising updated child interests to refine our recommendations over time.  \n  \nWe are seeking a talented freelancer to create a database of affiliate gift products on Xano. Initially, the data input is via CSV upload, but other affiliate marketplaces might require a scraping, or API integration.  \n  \nWe then require the development of a gift finder tool on a platform like Bubble or webflow. This finder will take user inputs (age, gender, budget, interests) and then use AI & Xano to present the user with the best possible gift ideas. The links will then direct the user to the partner website with a view to us gaining a commission for that referral.  \n  \nThe ideal candidate should have experience with Xano, API integration, and Webflow/Bubble.io to deliver a seamless solution.  \n  \nIf you have a passion for creating user-friendly applications and robust databases, we would love to hear from you!  \n  \n- Do not contact me via email.  \n- I am looking for feedback and a quote on Phase 1 only, the MVP.  \n- That being said, once Phase 1 is complete and successful, I will move onto the next parts.  \n- I have attached a pdf which should some queries.
