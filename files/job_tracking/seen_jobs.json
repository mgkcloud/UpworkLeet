    "description": "I am seeking a developer or automation specialist to build a system that: 1. Parses incoming property leads (via email and/or SMS) to extract relevant information (address, price, units, etc.). 2. Queries RentCast (or a similar rent estimate service) to gather rental data (current rent, rent comps, etc.). 3. Populates a Google Sheet with key data (address, rent estimate, cash-on-cash return, etc.). 4. Handles special logic for multi-unit properties (7+ units) to store or transform data differently. 5. Keeps daily API costs to under $0.50/day. --- 2. Project Goals Automation: Eliminate manual copy-pasting of property addresses, rent estimates, and ROI calculations. Accuracy: Ensure data extracted and rent estimates are consistently accurate. Scalability & Cost Control: Handle a growing number of leads while staying within a $0.50/day API budget. --- 3. Scope and Requirements 3.1. Data Capture & Parsing 1. Sources: The system should capture data from: Email: Some leads arrive via email (with property details or direct links to listings). Text Messages (SMS): Some leads arrive via text, which may be forwarded through services like Twilio or Zapier. 2. Parsing Fields: Address (required for RentCast lookup) Property Purchase Price (if available) Number of Units (important for 7+ unit logic) Any additional fields that might be relevant (e.g., link to the listing, agent\u2019s contact info, etc.). 3. Preferred Tools (flexible): Zapier, Make (Integromat), or a custom solution in Python/Node.js/Google Apps Script. Must ensure reliability and easy maintainability. 3.2. RentCast Integration 1. Retrieve Rent Estimates: Use RentCast\u2019s API (or equivalent) to get current rent, high/low estimates, or average rents for the ZIP code. If the property listing already contains the current rent, incorporate that into the data. 2. API Cost Constraints: The system should not exceed $0.50/day in API usage. Minimize duplicates: Only call RentCast once per unique address. Potentially batch calls or check for repeated addresses. 3.3. Google Sheets Integration 1. Data Columns in Google Sheets should include (but aren\u2019t limited to): Timestamp (date the lead was processed) Address Purchase Price Number of Units Monthly Rent Estimate Other rent comps or relevant data from RentCast Cash-on-Cash Return (see next section) Notes or Status field for manual follow-up. 2. Handling 7+ Units: If Units less than 7, either: Insert data into a separate tab (e.g., \u201c7+ Units\u201d tab), or Encode or summarize the data differently (e.g., partial data, redacted financials). 3.4. Cash-on-Cash Return Calculation 1. Inputs: Purchase Price (from the lead or manually estimated) Rent (from the listing and/or RentCast estimates) Down Payment (might be a standard % or a column in the sheet) Expenses (option to assume a percentage or a fixed amount) Mortgage Payment (if financed; can be estimated or left as a variable input) 2. Formula: Annual Net Cash Flow = (Monthly Rent \u2013 Monthly Expenses \u2013 Mortgage) \u00d7 12 Total Cash Invested = Down Payment + Closing Costs (if applicable) Cash-on-Cash Return % = (Annual Net Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) \u00d7 100 3. Implementation: Can be calculated within Google Sheets (preferred for easier tweaking of assumptions). Alternatively, can be calculated in the automation script. 3.5. Error Handling & Edge Cases 1. Duplicate Addresses: If the same property address is sent multiple times, ensure we do not duplicate RentCast calls unnecessarily. 2. Missing Data: Some leads may be missing purchase price or unit count. The system should log them but still attempt to fill whatever data is available. 3. Notification/Logging: If a lead is processed successfully, optionally send a notification (email or Slack) if it meets a certain ROI threshold (optional). --- 4. Technical Details & Constraints 5. Platform/Hosting: If using a no-code tool (Zapier, Make), you must specify the steps needed. If using a custom script (e.g., Google Apps Script or a serverless function), it must be well-documented for future maintenance. 6. User Authentication: Securely handle the RentCast API key (do not store in plain text in public code repositories). 7. Daily API Budget: Provide a method to track the number of calls to ensure we stay under $0.50/day. Implement caching or a check on previously-seen addresses. 8. Google Sheet Setup: Must be able to handle 100+ properties without performance issues. Must accommodate dynamic columns for additional data or notes. --- 5. Deliverables 6. Fully Functional Automated Workflow Demonstrates end-to-end process: from an example email/SMS to data populating in Google Sheets with rent estimates and calculations. 7. Configuration & Setup Guide Instructions on how to set up or modify the API keys (RentCast, Twilio, etc.). Instructions on how to edit the Google Sheet formulas or columns. 8. Source Code/Access If code-based: Provide the script files or links to GitHub. If no-code: Provide screenshots or instructions for the Zapier/Make workflows. 9. Testing & Validation At least one test property address to confirm the system retrieves rent data, calculates ROI, and handles the 7+ unit logic. 10. Documentation A short write-up on how to maintain and troubleshoot the system in case of errors (e.g., API downtime, changes in email format). --- 6. Timeline Proposal Submission: Immediately upon job posting. Project Start: Within 1 week of awarding the job. MVP Completion: 1\u20132 weeks after project start (basic address parsing + rent data retrieval + sheet entry). Final Delivery: 2\u20133 weeks after project start (include the ROI calculations, 7+ unit handling, thorough testing). --- 7. Budget Open to proposals, with an emphasis on: Minimizing monthly costs (aiming for $15/month total, including the RentCast usage). Ensuring reliability of the automation. --- 8. Selection Criteria 9. Relevant Experience: Experience with property analysis, automating email/SMS parsing, Google Sheets, or Zapier/Make. 10. Portfolio/References: Previous work or references for similar automation tasks. 11. Solution Approach: Clear plan to keep API calls under $0.50/day, handle duplicates, and maintain data integrity. 12. Communication & Documentation: Ability to provide clear instructions and maintenance guidance. --- 9. How to Apply / Next Steps Submit a brief proposal explaining: 1. Your approach (Zapier? Custom script?) 2. High-level architecture you envision 3. Estimated timeline and cost Provide examples or links to similar projects you\u2019ve completed. Include the word \u201cPropertyROI\u201d in your response to confirm you\u2019ve read the details. --- Also want realtor interface to see scenarios and enter repairs or answer missing quality questions about property Bonus $15 if can like with offermarket us for rates AI generated",
