The agent\nresponds to callers giving business information, pricing and FAQs. It also\nsets appointments by looking at a calendar (already setup) and suggests\navailable times.  \n  \nCurrent tech stack  \nGCP - google calendar  \nN8n - workflows  \nVAPI - voice AI  \nOpenAI - chat summarisation  \nTwilio - phone number  \n  \nWe are stuck on a Stripe implementation where the agent sends a payment link\n(eg via email or SMS) to the caller to make a payment to confirm the\nappointment. Need support specifically in completing this part of the flow.  \n  \nSo the flow should be  \n1. Caller rings number  \n2.  AI agent answers and provides business information, and offers to  set up an appointment   \n3. Callers asks availability on certain days  \n4. agent checks calendar and confirms or proposes alternative times  \n5. Caller agree on time, agent books the appointment and sends calendar\ninvite and confirms booking over phone, then politely ends call.  \n  \n  \nAdditional step to be added  \n- before step 5 above, Agent asks caller for email address to send a payment\nlink (stripe)  \n- after caller completes payment - agent checks for payment confirmation. If\nconfirmed, agent tells caller that the payment is successful and then we move\nto step 5 above.  \n- If payment unsuccessful, it tells caller that it was unsuccessful and asks\nto try again. If still unsuccessful, it tells caller that the appointment is\nnot confirmed and that we will pass on to someone who will call back to take\npayment over the phone.  \n  \nThis should be a quick integration as it is testing the flow and stripe\nintegration. We have done most of the work and requires an experienced AI\nagent to complete.  \n  \nThis must be completed by Friday this week.",
