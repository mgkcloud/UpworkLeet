    "description": "I am seeking a developer or automation specialist to build a system that:1. Parses incoming property leads (via email and/or SMS) to extract relevant\ninformation (address, price, units, etc.).2. Queries RentCast (or a similar rent estimate service) to gather rental\ndata (current rent, rent comps, etc.).3. Populates a Google Sheet with key data (address, rent estimate, cash-on-\ncash return, etc.).4. Handles special logic for multi-unit properties (7+ units) to store or\ntransform data differently.5. Keeps daily API costs to under $0.50/day.\n---2. Project GoalsAutomation: Eliminate manual copy-pasting of property addresses, rent\nestimates, and ROI calculations.Accuracy: Ensure data extracted and rent estimates are consistently accurate.Scalability & Cost Control: Handle a growing number of leads while staying\nwithin a $0.50/day API budget.\n---3. Scope and Requirements3.1. Data Capture & Parsing1. Sources: The system should capture data from:\nEmail: Some leads arrive via email (with property details or direct links to\nlistings).Text Messages (SMS): Some leads arrive via text, which may be forwarded\nthrough services like Twilio or Zapier.2. Parsing Fields:\nAddress (required for RentCast lookup)Property Purchase Price (if available)Number of Units (important for 7+ unit logic)Any additional fields that might be relevant (e.g., link to the listing,\nagent\u2019s contact info, etc.).3. Preferred Tools (flexible):\nZapier, Make (Integromat), or a custom solution in Python/Node.js/Google Apps\nScript.Must ensure reliability and easy maintainability.3.2. RentCast Integration1. Retrieve Rent Estimates:\nUse RentCast\u2019s API (or equivalent) to get current rent, high/low estimates, or\naverage rents for the ZIP code.If the property listing already contains the current rent, incorporate that\ninto the data.2. API Cost Constraints:\nThe system should not exceed $0.50/day in API usage.Minimize duplicates: Only call RentCast once per unique address.Potentially batch calls or check for repeated addresses.3.3. Google Sheets Integration1. Data Columns in Google Sheets should include (but aren\u2019t limited to):\nTimestamp (date the lead was processed)AddressPurchase PriceNumber of UnitsMonthly Rent EstimateOther rent comps or relevant data from RentCastCash-on-Cash Return (see next section)Notes or Status field for manual follow-up.2. Handling 7+ Units:\nIf Units less than 7, either:\nInsert data into a separate tab (e.g., \u201c7+ Units\u201d tab), orEncode or summarize the data differently (e.g., partial data, redacted\nfinancials).3.4. Cash-on-Cash Return Calculation1. Inputs:\nPurchase Price (from the lead or manually estimated)Rent (from the listing and/or RentCast estimates)Down Payment (might be a standard % or a column in the sheet)Expenses (option to assume a percentage or a fixed amount)Mortgage Payment (if financed; can be estimated or left as a variable input)2. Formula:\nAnnual Net Cash Flow = (Monthly Rent \u2013 Monthly Expenses \u2013 Mortgage) \u00d7 12Total Cash Invested = Down Payment + Closing Costs (if applicable)Cash-on-Cash Return % = (Annual Net Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) \u00d7 1003. Implementation:\nCan be calculated within Google Sheets (preferred for easier tweaking of\nassumptions).Alternatively, can be calculated in the automation script.3.5. Error Handling & Edge Cases1. Duplicate Addresses: If the same property address is sent multiple times,\nensure we do not duplicate RentCast calls unnecessarily.2. Missing Data: Some leads may be missing purchase price or unit count. The\nsystem should log them but still attempt to fill whatever data is available.3. Notification/Logging: If a lead is processed successfully, optionally send\na notification (email or Slack) if it meets a certain ROI threshold\n(optional).\n---4. Technical Details & Constraints5. Platform/Hosting:\nIf using a no-code tool (Zapier, Make), you must specify the steps needed.If using a custom script (e.g., Google Apps Script or a serverless function),\nit must be well-documented for future maintenance.6. User Authentication:\nSecurely handle the RentCast API key (do not store in plain text in public\ncode repositories).7. Daily API Budget:\nProvide a method to track the number of calls to ensure we stay under\n$0.50/day.Implement caching or a check on previously-seen addresses.8. Google Sheet Setup:\nMust be able to handle 100+ properties without performance issues.Must accommodate dynamic columns for additional data or notes.\n---5. Deliverables6. Fully Functional Automated Workflow\nDemonstrates end-to-end process: from an example email/SMS to data populating\nin Google Sheets with rent estimates and calculations.7. Configuration & Setup Guide\nInstructions on how to set up or modify the API keys (RentCast, Twilio, etc.).Instructions on how to edit the Google Sheet formulas or columns.8. Source Code/Access\nIf code-based: Provide the script files or links to GitHub.If no-code: Provide screenshots or instructions for the Zapier/Make workflows.9. Testing & Validation\nAt least one test property address to confirm the system retrieves rent data,\ncalculates ROI, and handles the 7+ unit logic.10. Documentation\nA short write-up on how to maintain and troubleshoot the system in case of\nerrors (e.g., API downtime, changes in email format).\n---6. TimelineProposal Submission: Immediately upon job posting.Project Start: Within 1 week of awarding the job.MVP Completion: 1\u20132 weeks after project start (basic address parsing + rent\ndata retrieval + sheet entry).Final Delivery: 2\u20133 weeks after project start (include the ROI calculations,\n7+ unit handling, thorough testing).\n---7. BudgetOpen to proposals, with an emphasis on:\nMinimizing monthly costs (aiming for $15/month total, including the RentCast\nusage).Ensuring reliability of the automation.\n---8. Selection Criteria9. Relevant Experience: Experience with property analysis, automating\nemail/SMS parsing, Google Sheets, or Zapier/Make.10. Portfolio/References: Previous work or references for similar automation\ntasks.11. Solution Approach: Clear plan to keep API calls under $0.50/day, handle\nduplicates, and maintain data integrity.12. Communication & Documentation: Ability to provide clear instructions and\nmaintenance guidance.\n---9. How to Apply / Next StepsSubmit a brief proposal explaining:1. Your approach (Zapier? Custom script?)2. High-level architecture you envision3. Estimated timeline and costProvide examples or links to similar projects you\u2019ve completed.Include the word \u201cPropertyROI\u201d in your response to confirm you\u2019ve read the\ndetails.\n---Also want realtor interface to see scenarios and enter repairs or answer\nmissing quality questions about propertyBonus $15 if can like with offermarket us for ratesAI generated",
