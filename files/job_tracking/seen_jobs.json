    "description": "I am seeking a developer or automation specialist to build a system that:\n\n1. Parses incoming property leads (via email and/or SMS) to extract relevant\ninformation (address, price, units, etc.).\n\n2. Queries RentCast (or a similar rent estimate service) to gather rental\ndata (current rent, rent comps, etc.).\n\n3. Populates a Google Sheet with key data (address, rent estimate, cash-on-\ncash return, etc.).\n\n4. Handles special logic for multi-unit properties (7+ units) to store or\ntransform data differently.\n\n5. Keeps daily API costs to under $0.50/day.\n\n\n---\n\n2. Project Goals\n\n\n\nAutomation: Eliminate manual copy-pasting of property addresses, rent\nestimates, and ROI calculations.\n\nAccuracy: Ensure data extracted and rent estimates are consistently accurate.\n\nScalability & Cost Control: Handle a growing number of leads while staying\nwithin a $0.50/day API budget.\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. Scope and Requirements\n\n\n\n3.1. Data Capture & Parsing\n\n1. Sources: The system should capture data from:\n\nEmail: Some leads arrive via email (with property details or direct links to\nlistings).\n\nText Messages (SMS): Some leads arrive via text, which may be forwarded\nthrough services like Twilio or Zapier.\n\n\n\n2. Parsing Fields:\n\nAddress (required for RentCast lookup)\n\nProperty Purchase Price (if available)\n\nNumber of Units (important for 7+ unit logic)\n\nAny additional fields that might be relevant (e.g., link to the listing,\nagent\u2019s contact info, etc.).\n\n\n\n3. Preferred Tools (flexible):\n\nZapier, Make (Integromat), or a custom solution in Python/Node.js/Google Apps\nScript.\n\nMust ensure reliability and easy maintainability.\n\n\n\n\n3.2. RentCast Integration\n\n1. Retrieve Rent Estimates:\n\nUse RentCast\u2019s API (or equivalent) to get current rent, high/low estimates, or\naverage rents for the ZIP code.\n\nIf the property listing already contains the current rent, incorporate that\ninto the data.\n\n\n\n2. API Cost Constraints:\n\nThe system should not exceed $0.50/day in API usage.\n\nMinimize duplicates: Only call RentCast once per unique address.\n\nPotentially batch calls or check for repeated addresses.\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Google Sheets Integration\n\n1. Data Columns in Google Sheets should include (but aren\u2019t limited to):\n\nTimestamp (date the lead was processed)\n\nAddress\n\nPurchase Price\n\nNumber of Units\n\nMonthly Rent Estimate\n\nOther rent comps or relevant data from RentCast\n\nCash-on-Cash Return (see next section)\n\nNotes or Status field for manual follow-up.\n\n\n\n2. Handling 7+ Units:\n\nIf Units less than 7, either:\n\nInsert data into a separate tab (e.g., \u201c7+ Units\u201d tab), or\n\nEncode or summarize the data differently (e.g., partial data, redacted\nfinancials).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4. Cash-on-Cash Return Calculation\n\n1. Inputs:\n\nPurchase Price (from the lead or manually estimated)\n\nRent (from the listing and/or RentCast estimates)\n\nDown Payment (might be a standard % or a column in the sheet)\n\nExpenses (option to assume a percentage or a fixed amount)\n\nMortgage Payment (if financed; can be estimated or left as a variable input)\n\n\n\n2. Formula:\n\nAnnual Net Cash Flow = (Monthly Rent \u2013 Monthly Expenses \u2013 Mortgage) \u00d7 12\n\nTotal Cash Invested = Down Payment + Closing Costs (if applicable)\n\nCash-on-Cash Return % = (Annual Net Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) \u00d7 100\n\n\n\n3. Implementation:\n\nCan be calculated within Google Sheets (preferred for easier tweaking of\nassumptions).\n\nAlternatively, can be calculated in the automation script.\n\n\n\n\n3.5. Error Handling & Edge Cases\n\n1. Duplicate Addresses: If the same property address is sent multiple times,\nensure we do not duplicate RentCast calls unnecessarily.\n\n\n2. Missing Data: Some leads may be missing purchase price or unit count. The\nsystem should log them but still attempt to fill whatever data is available.\n\n\n3. Notification/Logging: If a lead is processed successfully, optionally send\na notification (email or Slack) if it meets a certain ROI threshold\n(optional).\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Technical Details & Constraints\n\n\n5. Platform/Hosting:\n\nIf using a no-code tool (Zapier, Make), you must specify the steps needed.\n\nIf using a custom script (e.g., Google Apps Script or a serverless function),\nit must be well-documented for future maintenance.\n\n\n\n6. User Authentication:\n\nSecurely handle the RentCast API key (do not store in plain text in public\ncode repositories).\n\n\n\n7. Daily API Budget:\n\nProvide a method to track the number of calls to ensure we stay under\n$0.50/day.\n\nImplement caching or a check on previously-seen addresses.\n\n\n\n8. Google Sheet Setup:\n\nMust be able to handle 100+ properties without performance issues.\n\nMust accommodate dynamic columns for additional data or notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. Deliverables\n\n\n6. Fully Functional Automated Workflow\n\nDemonstrates end-to-end process: from an example email/SMS to data populating\nin Google Sheets with rent estimates and calculations.\n\n\n\n7. Configuration & Setup Guide\n\nInstructions on how to set up or modify the API keys (RentCast, Twilio, etc.).\n\nInstructions on how to edit the Google Sheet formulas or columns.\n\n\n\n8. Source Code/Access\n\nIf code-based: Provide the script files or links to GitHub.\n\nIf no-code: Provide screenshots or instructions for the Zapier/Make workflows.\n\n\n\n9. Testing & Validation\n\nAt least one test property address to confirm the system retrieves rent data,\ncalculates ROI, and handles the 7+ unit logic.\n\n\n\n10. Documentation\n\nA short write-up on how to maintain and troubleshoot the system in case of\nerrors (e.g., API downtime, changes in email format).\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n6. Timeline\n\n\n\nProposal Submission: Immediately upon job posting.\n\nProject Start: Within 1 week of awarding the job.\n\nMVP Completion: 1\u20132 weeks after project start (basic address parsing + rent\ndata retrieval + sheet entry).\n\nFinal Delivery: 2\u20133 weeks after project start (include the ROI calculations,\n7+ unit handling, thorough testing).\n\n\n\n---\n\n7. Budget\n\n\n\nOpen to proposals, with an emphasis on:\n\nMinimizing monthly costs (aiming for $15/month total, including the RentCast\nusage).\n\nEnsuring reliability of the automation.\n\n\n\n---\n\n8. Selection Criteria\n\n\n9. Relevant Experience: Experience with property analysis, automating\nemail/SMS parsing, Google Sheets, or Zapier/Make.\n\n\n10. Portfolio/References: Previous work or references for similar automation\ntasks.\n\n\n11. Solution Approach: Clear plan to keep API calls under $0.50/day, handle\nduplicates, and maintain data integrity.\n\n\n12. Communication & Documentation: Ability to provide clear instructions and\nmaintenance guidance.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n9. How to Apply / Next Steps\n\n\n\nSubmit a brief proposal explaining:\n\n1. Your approach (Zapier? Custom script?)\n\n\n2. High-level architecture you envision\n\n\n3. Estimated timeline and cost\n\n\n\nProvide examples or links to similar projects you\u2019ve completed.\nInclude the word \u201cPropertyROI\u201d in your response to confirm you\u2019ve read the\ndetails.\n\n\n---\n\nAlso want realtor interface to see scenarios and enter repairs or answer\nmissing quality questions about property\n\nBonus $15 if can like with offermarket us for rates\n\nAI generated",

    "description": "A previous developer helped me build an AI voice agent in VAPI and n8n.  \n  \nThe agent currently takes inbound calls like a receptionist. The agent responds to callers giving business information, pricing and FAQs. It also sets appointments by looking at a calendar (already setup) and suggests available times.  \n  \nCurrent tech stack  \nGCP - google calendar  \nN8n - workflows  \nVAPI - voice AI  \nOpenAI - chat summarisation  \nTwilio - phone number  \n  \nWe are stuck on a Stripe implementation where the agent sends a payment link (eg via email or SMS) to the caller to make a payment to confirm the appointment. Need support specifically in completing this part of the flow.  \n  \nSo the flow should be  \n1. Caller rings number  \n2.  AI agent answers and provides business information, and offers to  set up an appointment   \n3. Callers asks availability on certain days  \n4. agent checks calendar and confirms or proposes alternative times  \n5. Caller agree on time, agent books the appointment and sends calendar\ninvite and confirms booking over phone, then politely ends call.  \n  \n  \nAdditional step to be added  \n- before step 5 above, Agent asks caller for email address to send a payment\nlink (stripe)  \n- after caller completes payment - agent checks for payment confirmation. If\nconfirmed, agent tells caller that the payment is successful and then we move\nto step 5 above.  \n- If payment unsuccessful, it tells caller that it was unsuccessful and asks\nto try again. If still unsuccessful, it tells caller that the appointment is\nnot confirmed and that we will pass on to someone who will call back to take\npayment over the phone.  \n  \nThis should be a quick integration as it is testing the flow and stripe\nintegration. We have done most of the work and requires an experienced AI\nagent to complete.  \n  \nThis must be completed by Friday this week.",

    "description": "We are looking to build an AI-powered classroom website for teachers, very similar in functionality to Google Classroom except this will include AI chat tasks that are graded.  \n  \nThe website will allow teachers to create and manage multiple classrooms for different subjects. In each classroom, the teacher can upload educational content in the form of PDF files to serve as modules. Students can access and complete tasks.  \n  \nFeatures:  \n  \n    Teachers can create modules and upload PDF files with relevant content.  \n    Teachers can set instructions for the AI bot (e.g., \"10 questions a day on addition\").  \n    Students log into their profiles daily, select the module, and interact with the AI chatbot.  \n    The AI bot will present 10 questions, and when the student answers correctly, it will proceed to the next question. If the student answers incorrectly, the bot will explain the mistake and allow the student to ask questions before moving forward.  \n    At the end of the 10 questions, the AI bot records the student\u2019s score, which is saved in a gradebook similar to Google Classroom.  \n    The platform tracks the student\u2019s overall progress and grades across multiple modules (e.g., Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division for math).  \n  \nTeacher\u2019s Dashboard:  \n  \n    Teachers can monitor student progress, view grades, and track the completion of modules.  \n    Teachers can create different classrooms for various subjects and upload multiple modules for each.  \n  \nAdditional Requirement: The website should be designed with future mobile app\nintegration in mind. We plan to transition the platform into a mobile app\n(iOS) via the App Store at a later point, allowing students to easily access\nand complete their modules on their phones. Please design the site with this\nscalability in mind.  \n  \nRequirements:  \n  \n    Experience in building interactive web platforms with AI integration.  \n    Familiarity with building gradebook systems and dashboards for educators.  \n    Experience with chatbot development and AI-powered learning tools.  \n    WordPress is the preferred platform for this project. We are looking for a developer who is experienced with WordPress and its plugins. Please include suggestions for any plugins you would consider using to build the site.  \n  \nTo Be Considered: If you are interested in this project, please submit a proof\nof concept. This could include any past AI-integrated projects (student,\nteacher, or user group projects, etc.) and a clear plan for how you would\nexecute this project. Please include details on the plugins you would use, how\nyou would integrate the AI functionality, and any tools or technologies you\nwould recommend for this build.",

    "description": "We\u2019re building an AI-powered SaaS platform aimed at revolutionizing healthcare communication. Our goal is to create a real-time speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and live language translation system tailored specifically for medical environments. This system must be able to handle multiple languages, be extremely accurate in its translations, and operate seamlessly in real-time, ensuring it can be used in high-stress situations without errors. One of our key challenges is ensuring voice differentiation based on context \u2014 for instance, the system should automatically detect whether it's a male or female speaker and adjust the voice accordingly. We also need the platform to provide natural-sounding speech outputs, so the voice feels human and approachable, particularly in high-stress healthcare settings where patient comfort and trust are critical. We\u2019re also very focused on making sure the system\u2019s output is clear and easy to understand in emergency scenarios. The system must adhere to the strictest privacy standards and comply with GDPR regulations, as we will be handling sensitive patient data. We need someone with experience in building secure, scalable platforms with a deep understanding of AI, natural language processing, and large language models like GPT, as well as real-time data processing. Ideally, you\u2019ll also have experience integrating APIs, working with cloud services, and ensuring smooth interactions between text, voice, and various languages in real-time. You should be comfortable working with both frontend and backend technologies, have a strong grasp of SaaS development, and be capable of collaborating with a team to deliver timely, high-quality work. We value innovation and are looking for a partner who\u2019s excited about the opportunity to push boundaries in healthcare technology. We also need someone who understands the importance of accuracy, reliability, and empathy when it comes to medical communication, as this could significantly impact the quality of care that the patients receive. This is a chance to join a project with a huge potential for positive impact on millions of people around the world. If you\u2019re passionate about AI, healthcare, and solving real-world problems, we\u2019d love to have you on board. Let\u2019s work together to build something that can truly make a difference in the lives of patients and healthcare professionals everywhere. Thank you.",

    "description": "I need help using AI/automation to create our monthly eCommerce SEO newsletter each month.  Here are some examples of how the newsletter should look:  - <https://www.180marketing.com/this-month-in-ecommerce-seo-may-2024/>  - <https://www.180marketing.com/this-month-in-ecommerce-seo-june-2024/>  - <https://www.180marketing.com/this-month-in-ecommerce-seo-july-2024/>    Here's the process we've been doing manually so far:    Step 1 - Find recently published articles to feature in the newsletter that would appeal to eCommerce store owners who are interested/curious about SEO. Here's a list of approved sources to pull articles from:  <https://sparktoro.com/blog/> <https://detailed.com/latest/> <https://zyppy.com/seo/> <https://www.growth-memo.com/archive> <https://ipullrank.com/blog> <https://www.semrush.com/blog/> <https://ahrefs.com/blog/> <https://searchengineland.com/library/seo> <https://www.seroundtable.com/category/google> <https://www.searchenginejournal.com/category/seo/> <https://brodieclark.com/notes/>    Step 2 - Write a 1 paragraph summary with 2-4 sentences for each for each article.    Step 3 - Write 3-5 bullet points detailing the key takeaways from each article, and why an eCommerce store owner should care.    Step 4 - Write a unique \"SEO Tip of the Month\" to feature at the beginning of the newsletter that is helpful and actionable.    Step 5 - Publish to Wordpress    ### Expectations ###    I'm hoping to automate as much or all of this process as possible, while generating outputs that are very close to the previous newsletter examples:  - <https://www.180marketing.com/this-month-in-ecommerce-seo-may-2024/>  - <https://www.180marketing.com/this-month-in-ecommerce-seo-june-2024/>  - <https://www.180marketing.com/this-month-in-ecommerce-seo-july-2024/>    I will be testing the automation for December 2024 to assess the quality of the newsletter. There's a few things I will be looking for.  1. How appealing are the selected articles for an eCommerce store owner?  2. How well written are the article summaries?  3. How insightful are the article takeaways?  4. Does the style and tone match the newsletter examples provided?",
