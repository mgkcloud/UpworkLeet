I'm confident in keeping daily API costs under budget and handling data caching efficiently.\n*   **Data Handling:** I have experience with Google Sheets and can create robust integrations with dynamic columns and large datasets. I also have a strong database background in both SQL and NoSQL databases.\n*   **Project Management:** I have a proven track record of successfully delivering projects on time and within budget, and use a very collaborative and structured work approach.\n\n# Client Questions\n\n**Question 1:** Can you describe your experience with parsing data from emails and SMS?\n**Suggested Answer:** I've built systems using AI-powered parsing techniques to extract structured data from various text formats, including emails and SMS messages. I can adapt these systems to identify property-specific details like address, price, and unit count using LLMs and pattern recognition.\n\n**Question 2:** How do you plan to keep API costs for RentCast under $0.50/day?\n**Suggested Answer:** I will implement a caching strategy to store results for previously requested addresses and/or batch requests to RentCast's API to minimize redundant API calls. I also understand that daily API budgets should be closely monitored.\n\n**Question 3:** What approach would you take to handle duplicate property addresses?\n**Suggested Answer:** I\u2019ll implement a system to check for existing addresses before querying RentCast to prevent unnecessary API calls. I can also log duplicate entries and ensure each data entry has a unique ID, and include a status/notes field in the Google Sheet.\n\n**Question 4:** How would you integrate RentCast's data into Google Sheets?\n**Suggested Answer:** I will use either Google Apps Script or a webhook approach, depending on what works best, to pull relevant data from RentCast\u2019s API. I\u2019ll then populate that data into designated columns in your Google Sheet and ensure that the data is clean and structured.\n\n**Question 5:** How would you handle different data formats from various sources (email vs. SMS)?\n**Suggested Answer:** I will use a combination of rule-based parsing and natural language processing to normalize data from different sources. I will build logic to handle variations in formats for both email and SMS messages so that data can be consistently extracted.\n\n**Question 6:** What is your preferred method for handling 7+ unit properties?\n**Suggested Answer:** Based on our discussion, I recommend either putting them in a separate tab or encoding the data differently to keep the information concise. I am happy to implement the most practical solution for you, depending on your specific needs.\n\n**Question 7:** How would you calculate cash-on-cash return in Google Sheets?\n**Suggested Answer:** I can develop a formula within Google Sheets using the extracted purchase price, rent estimates, and any other manually inputted data, like down payment and expenses. This way, you\u2019ll be able to easily adjust variables and see their effect on the return.\n\n**Question 8:** What is your approach to error handling and logging?\n**Suggested Answer:** I will implement robust error handling to catch edge cases, log missing data, and ensure the system operates reliably. I\u2019ll also include a status or notes field for each entry in the Google Sheet so you can manually look at or update any issues.\n\n**Question 9:** Can you describe your experience with no-code automation platforms like Zapier or Make?\n**Suggested Answer:** While my preference is n8n, I have experience with Zapier and Make, including developing complex multi-step workflows and connecting them to various APIs. I can use either no-code or custom-code approaches depending on the requirements.\n\n**Question 10:** What are your thoughts on the current project timeline?\n**Suggested Answer:** The proposed timeline of 2-3 weeks for the full deliverable looks reasonable. I can prioritize the MVP with data parsing and rent retrieval within 1-2 weeks, while finalizing the ROI calculations and special logic afterward. I aim to provide regular progress updates so that we stay aligned.\n\n# Questions to Ask\n\n**Question 1:** Can you provide more examples of the types of emails and SMS messages you receive to further test parsing?\n\n**Question 2:** Are there any specific formats for multi-unit properties or any particular fields that are of the highest importance in data extraction?\n\n**Question 3:** How often do you anticipate adding new properties? Is the sheet expected to grow quickly or by a few properties each day?\n\n**Question 4:** Is there an existing Google Sheet already set up or any preferences on its layout?\n\n**Question 5:** What is your preferred method for the 7+ unit property handling (separate sheet, encoded data, etc.)?\n\n**Question 6:** What method would you like to use for the calculation of the cash-on-cash return, within the script or inside Google Sheets?\n\n**Question 7:** Are there any specific metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) you would like to monitor?\n\n**Question 8:** Are there any other integrations you may want in the future, such as connecting to offermarket, as mentioned in the project description?\n\n**Question 9:** What is the expected frequency and number of leads (email and SMS) per day, week, or month?\n\n**Question 10:** Do you have a specific API key management preference? Do you want me to use an environment variable, etc.?"
