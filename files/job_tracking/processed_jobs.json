I use graph databases to explore data, discover patterns, and get useful insights from agent behavior and interactions.\"\n\n**Q8: How do you ensure the quality of work produced by an agentic team?**\nA8: \"I implement rigorous review processes, often involving a reviewer LLM which gives a numerical score according to the initial instructions. This review process ensures that the output meets the required quality standards. The reviewer LLM also provides feedback for continuous improvement of the agents involved. I also utilize a human-in-the-loop approach to get final validation or to provide additional insight when the automated system is unable to meet the expected quality.\"\n\n**Q9: How would you handle conflicting instructions or priorities within an agentic team?**\nA9: \"I would implement a system to prioritize instructions and manage conflicts. This could involve having a central coordinator or a system that allows agents to negotiate and resolve conflicting requests. I also prioritize understanding the reasons behind conflicting instructions to determine if they are symptomatic of a problem with the instructions themselves.\"\n\n**Q10: Can you share an example of a project where you successfully implemented an agentic system?**\nA10: \"In a previous project, I built an agentic team to automate the process of content creation. The team included agents for researching, writing, editing and optimizing content. By utilizing collaborative communication and feedback mechanisms, the system was able to produce high-quality content significantly faster than previous methods. The iterative training loops I implemented also led to significant improvements in content quality. I used n8n to orchestrate this process.

I can also provide a README file if needed.\n\n**8.  Question:** What if you encounter unexpected roadblocks during the integration?\n    **Suggested Answer:** I'm adept at problem-solving and will first try to identify the root cause of the issue, then implement the necessary changes.  If the issue is time sensitive, I will discuss the potential solutions with you as soon as possible, and give my honest opinion about the best path forwards.\n\n**9.  Question:** How do you ensure security when handling payment information?\n   **Suggested Answer:** I am always mindful about security issues. I never store sensitive information. I will always follow Stripe best practices when handling API keys.

Or both?\n**3.**  Can you provide access to a test Stripe environment for the development and testing phase?\n**4.**  Are there specific error messages that you would like me to customize in the payment failure flow?\n**5.**  Are there any specific branding or customizations you have in mind for the Stripe payment page?\n**6.**  Is there already an error handling set up in the n8n workflow? Should this error handling be expanded to accommodate payment issues?\n**7.**  Do you have any particular monitoring and logging tools already in place?\n**8.**  Is there a specific time of day that you would like to schedule the payment checks?\n**9.**  What is the desired user experience when the payment is unsuccessful? How many attempts are needed before moving to a manual call back?\n**10.** What is your preferred method of communication and check in during the project?",
