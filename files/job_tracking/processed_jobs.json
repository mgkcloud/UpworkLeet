I\u2019m confident in my ability to build a robust, LLM-agnostic system for your innovative agentic team.\n\nBest,\nAymen",
      "interview_script": "# Introduction\n\nHi [Client Name], I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited about the opportunity to discuss the AI Agentic Systems Expert role. I have been closely following the developments in agentic AI and I'm particularly drawn to the innovative approach your company is taking. I have a strong background in developing and implementing AI systems, with a focus on collaborative models using cutting edge tools.\n\n# Key Points\n\n*   **Agentic Architecture Expertise:** Proven experience in designing, developing, and deploying agentic AI systems, similar to what is required for this role.\n*   **Proficiency with LLMs:** Deep understanding of large language models (LLMs), their capabilities, and how to integrate them effectively into agentic frameworks.\n*   **Orchestration Tool Mastery:** Hands-on experience with orchestration tools such as Langchain, AutoCrew, n8n, and MemGPT, demonstrating a practical understanding of how to build dynamic agentic systems.\n*   **Feedback Mechanism Development:**  Experienced in building feedback mechanisms within AI systems to ensure continuous training and improvement of each LLM.\n*   **Graph Database Skills:** Proficiency in data modeling, particularly with graph databases like Neo4j, which supports the system's ability to store and utilize persistent memory.\n*   **Recursive Loop Implementation:** Designed systems with recursive loops that facilitate the continuous training and improvement of each agent.\n*   **LLM Agnostic Approach:** Develop solutions that work with various models, providing flexibility and adaptability in integrating different LLMs.\n\n# Client Questions\n\n**Question 1:** Can you describe your experience in developing agentic systems?\n**Suggested Answer:** In my previous role, I was responsible for building and implementing agentic systems where multiple LLMs collaborated to achieve specific goals. I used tools like Langchain and AutoGen to create dynamic agent teams, and I'm confident in my ability to develop the type of system you're looking for.\n\n**Question 2:** How familiar are you with Langchain, AutoCrew, and n8n?\n**Suggested Answer:** I have hands-on experience with all three. I've used Langchain for creating complex chains of agents, AutoCrew for defining agent roles and interactions, and n8n for automating the overall workflow. I can discuss specific projects where I\u2019ve used each, detailing the practical challenges and solutions.\n\n**Question 3:** Have you worked with recursive loops for LLM training?\n**Suggested Answer:** Yes, I have designed and implemented recursive loops that allow LLMs to continually train and improve. This involves setting up a feedback mechanism where the agents receive feedback on their performance and are able to use this feedback to refine their approach iteratively.\n\n**Question 4:** How do you ensure that the system you create is adaptable to different LLMs?\n**Suggested Answer:** I design systems to be LLM-agnostic by creating clear and consistent interfaces for interacting with the models. This abstraction allows easy integration and replacement of different LLMs as needed.\n\n**Question 5:** Can you describe your experience with graph databases like Neo4j?\n**Suggested Answer:** I have experience with using Neo4j to model and store interactions and responses within AI systems. This allows us to build persistent memory for agents, enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks.\n\n**Question 6:** How would you approach implementing a feedback mechanism for collaborative LLMs?\n**Suggested Answer:** I would set up a multi-stage feedback mechanism. Initially, each agent would provide feedback to the others. Then, a review agent would analyze their outputs, scoring them against the initial instructions. Finally, human operators would be able to provide targeted feedback to each agent.\n\n**Question 7:** How do you ensure that multiple LLMs can collaborate effectively?\n**Suggested Answer:** Clear role assignment and communication protocols are crucial. I use tools that enable structured communication and ensure that each agent has defined tasks and a clear understanding of the overall goal.\n\n**Question 8:** How do you handle situations where agents reach a dead end or cannot progress?\n**Suggested Answer:** I incorporate mechanisms for human intervention. Human operators can provide specific instructions or adjustments to overcome these challenges. I also build in a system to back out of dead ends and retry with modified parameters.\n\n**Question 9:** Can you discuss your experience with teams and how that has shaped your approach to collaborative AI systems?\n**Suggested Answer:** My experience in team environments has been invaluable. I understand the dynamics of collaboration and how different team members contribute unique perspectives. I've applied these insights to ensure that my AI systems can work collaboratively and effectively.\n\n**Question 10:** What is your understanding of the term \u201cperfect 10/10\u201d in the context of this project?\n**Suggested Answer:** The \"perfect 10/10\" score, in my understanding, is the benchmark that the final system has met every instruction from the initial prompt perfectly. This will be evaluated by a review LLM and human verification. It is a testament to the agent's performance and its ability to meet objectives as defined in the instructions.\n\n# Questions to Ask\n\n**Question 1:** What are the specific challenges you anticipate in developing this agentic system?\n\n**Question 2:** What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) that you will use to measure the success of this project?\n\n**Question 3:** What is the expected timeline for this project and what are the key milestones?\n\n**Question 4:** What specific LLMs will the system need to be compatible with?\n\n**Question 5:** What specific resources and tools will be available for this project?\n\n**Question 6:** Can you describe the team I would be collaborating with?\n\n**Question 7:** What is the process for providing feedback and iterating on the system\u2019s design?\n\n**Question 8:** Are there any specific examples of challenges the team is encountering now that I could help solve?\n\n**Question 9:** What does success look like for this role over the first few months?\n\n**Question 10:** What is the company culture like and how does it support innovation and growth?",

If they agree, the agent will then ask for availability on certain days. The agent will then check the calendar, confirm or propose alternative times. Once a time has been agreed, the agent asks for an email address, send the payment link and check for payment confirmation. if confirmed, agent informs caller of success, books and sends the invite. If not, tries again and if still unsuccessful, informs the caller that it is not confirmed and that someone will contact the caller.\n\n**9. Client Question:** How do you handle communication and updates on projects like this?\n   **Suggested Answer:** I'm proactive with communication. I'll provide daily progress updates and communicate any potential roadblocks immediately. I am happy to use the communication methods that best suit you, such as email, instant messaging or regular brief calls.\n\n**10. Client Question:** What would you do if you find that this project has unexpected difficulties?\n   **Suggested Answer:** If I encounter unexpected difficulties, I will first try to identify the root cause, and research possible solutions.
