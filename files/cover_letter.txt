### Job Description ###
Title: AI Agent automation to integrate with our software via Webhooks
Description:
Develop an AI bot that engages leads through conversational
messages and prompts, with a focus on securing call bookings in a natural,
non-intrusive way. The bot will integrate with our software via MAKE or
another solution of your choice and use Webhooks for real-time responses.  
  
Key Features:  
  
1\. Webhook Integration for Real-Time Data:  
• Event Triggers: The bot will connect through Webhooks to respond to specific
events like new lead creation, replies, and follow-up needs.  
• Instant Updates: Enable real-time data updates so the bot can adjust
responses based on how and when leads engage.  
2\. Customizable Follow-Up Scheduling:  
• Initial Delay: After a lead enters the system, wait a few minutes before
sending the first follow-up to make it feel more natural.  
• Adaptive Follow-Ups: Set multiple, customizable follow-up intervals (like 1
hour or 24 hours) if there’s no response.  
• Interest-Based Priority: If a lead responds positively, prioritize them in
the conversation flow for scheduling a call.  
3\. Conversational Strategy:  
• Friendly Follow-Ups: Use open-ended, friendly questions (e.g., “Would you be
open to a quick call to go over this in detail?”) to re-engage leads
naturally.  
• Soft Call-to-Action: For leads showing interest, move toward securing a call
in a relaxed manner.  
4\. Sales-Driven yet Casual Approach:  
• Focus on Call Bookings: Guide conversations toward booking a call in a
conversational tone that builds trust.  
• Flexible Info Sharing: If leads ask for more information, the bot will
provide concise details or a link, then wait for a response before continuing.  
  
  
  
Sample Conversation 1:  
  
1\. Initial Outreach:  
• Agent: “Hey Wasilie, is this a good way to connect? Drop me a line when
you’re about.”  
2\. Lead Response:  
• Wasilie Janssen: “Hi Olushola, I’m not sure what you have in mind with this
connection? What can we offer each other?”  
3\. Agent Response:  
• Agent: “Thanks for getting back to me, Wasilie! I’m working with a property
investment team doing some pretty exciting things. Would you be open to a
quick overview? I’d love your thoughts, even if you’re not in the market right
ow.”  
4\. Lead Engagement:  
• Wasilie Janssen: “Sure, feel free to share.”  
5\. Agent Shares Info:  
• Agent: “Thanks, Wasilie! Here’s the link: [Link]. We’re making real estate
accessible without the usual barriers. Let me know what you think!”  
6\. Follow-Up:  
• Agent (24 hours later): “Hey, Wasilie, just wanted to touch base on the info
I sent over—any initial thoughts?”  
7\. Lead Disinterest:  
• Wasilie Janssen: “Hi. Not interested, but good luck!”  
8\. Agent Wrap-Up:  
• Agent: “Understood, Wasilie! Thanks for taking a look, and all the best to
you too!”  
  
  
Sample Conversation 2:

connection. What’s the goal here?”  
3\. Agent Response:  
• Agent: “Thanks for reaching out, Wasilie! I’m not one for hard-selling, but
I’m with a property investment company doing some interesting work. If you’re
open to it, I’d be happy to share a bit about what we’re up to—no pressure on
your end.”  
4\. Lead Engagement:  
• Wasilie Janssen: “Alright, I’m interested in hearing more.”  
5\. Agent Shares Information:  
• Agent: “Appreciate that, Wasilie! Here’s a link to some details about us:
[Link]. We’re offering a straightforward way to invest in real estate,
minimizing the usual financial hurdles. Let me know if anything catches your
eye!”  
6\. Lead Shows Interest:  
• Wasilie Janssen: “This sounds good. I’m definitely interested in knowing
more, especially about how the investment works in practice.”  
7\. Agent Offers a Call:  
• Agent: “That’s great to hear, Wasilie! I think a quick call would be a
perfect way to dive into the details and answer any questions you have. Here’s
a link to schedule a time that works for you: [Calendly Link]. Let me know if
there’s anything specific you’d like to cover!”  
8\. Lead Books a Call:  
• Wasilie Janssen: “Booked a slot for tomorrow—looking forward to it!”  
9\. Agent Confirms:
